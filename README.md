# RPIZircord

--- This project needs a makeover. ---

A purely funny project, the aim is to display a sentence on a black background with letters in images via the Python system, as well as the title of a piece of music currently playing on Spotify via an API key.

The manual used is Papernotes.font

For this use, all you need is Python and the image font files.
